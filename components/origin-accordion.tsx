        This is a demonstration of using convex with ShadCN data table and{' '}
        <code>@tanstack/react-table</code>. I made some changes like in users
        table being able to have filtering with array (Like a user can have more
        than one role and it's being represented via an array), the tasks demo
        on ShadCN does not handle it very well, so I made it more versatile. In
        students table you can also see filtering via a lower and upper range
        for CGPA

        I wanted to use server side sorting/filtering and pagination (Pagination
        I tried with prop drilling and works) however, I do not believe it's
        feasible because it needs convex functions and there are only a million
        per month ðŸ™‚. I also do not know how to do server side filtering in an
        optimized way

        I hope to be able to do server side actions instead of client side
        sorting, whenever I feel ambitious. In a real project I am using this it
        is able to 500+ rows pretty fine
